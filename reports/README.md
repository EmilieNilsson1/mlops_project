# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

```markdown
![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)
```

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

Will generate a `.html` page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate a `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with

```bash
pip install typer markdown
```

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustive* which means that it includes everything that you could do on the project included in the
curriculum in this course. Therefore, we do not expect at all that you have checked all boxes at the end of the project.
The parenthesis at the end indicates what module the bullet point is related to. Please be honest in your answers, we
will check the repositories and the code to verify your answers.

>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:

We used the third-party framework 'TIMM' in our project. We used the functionality of the package to load pretrained models and to train our models. The package helped us to quickly load and train models, which saved us time on training and allowed us to focus on other parts of the project.

## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment. This includes
> how you managed dependencies, the structure of your code and how you managed code quality.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

We used a `requirements.txt` file to manage our dependencies. The file was auto-generated using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. To get a complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands:

conda create --<env_name> --file requirements.txt

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
>
> Answer:

From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the `configs`, `src`, `data`, `models`, `reports`, `tests`, and  `dockerfiles` folders. We have removed the `notebooks` and `docs` folders because we did not use any notebooks and did not write any documentation in our project. We have added an `outputs` folder that contains the logs for our experiments. We also added a template folder for the frontend to the API.

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? What about typing and documentation? Additionally,**
> **explain with your own words why these concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for linting and ... for formatting. We also used ... for typing and ... for documentation. These*
> *concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...*
>
> Answer:

We used ruff for linting and black for formatting to keep everything similar. We agreed that we should comment on the code to make it easier to read and understand.

Linting and formatting ensures that the code looks the same throughout the entire project and using packages like ruff and black makes it easier to do this, because it therefore it not nessecary to think about it as much during the codingproces. Typing og documantation is important in larger projects because they make the code easier to understand and interpret and explain the flow of the code and reasoning behind it. The concepts are important in larger prrojects because it makes it easier to read and understand the code.

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

We have implementet 13 pytest tests and 1 loadtest. We are testing the API, the data and the model. We are testing the most crucial parts of our application such as the datahandler, the different steps of the model, and the predictions and a loadtest of the API.

### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If your code had a code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

The total coverage is 92% with the missing coverage being lines that are basically non-testable. Even if we had a 100% coverage we would not trust the code to be error free because we test some specific things and it is almost impossible to make unittests that ensures that all possible errors are covered.

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each feature was developed on a separate branch. When the feature was completed, a PR was created to merge the feature branch into the main branch. This allowed us to work on different features simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.

### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*
>
> Answer:

We did not use DVC, because it did no make sense for our project. Version control of data is beneficial in scenarios where data is frequently updated or modified.

### Question 11

> **Discuss you continuous integration setup. What kind of continuous integration are you running (unittesting,**
> **linting, etc.)? Do you test multiple operating systems, Python  version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free**
> **to insert a link to one of your GitHub actions workflow.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 200-300 words.
>
> Example:
> *We have organized our continuous integration into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing*
> *and one for running ... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen*
> *here: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

We run continuos integration on ubuntu latest, MacOS latest and windows latest, python 3.11 and 3.12, torch versions 2.5.1, 2.41.1, 2.3.1 and all of our unittesting. 
We also made a configuation file that sets up a CI procces which is triggered by changes in our datafile. This trigger executes the train scrips and makes sure the model is always up to data with the newest data.

An example of a triggered workflow can be seen here: https://github.com/EmilieNilsson1/mlops_project/actions/workflows/tests.yaml

## Running code and tracking experiments

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
> especially the reproducibility of your experiments.

### Question 12

> **How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would**
> **run a experiment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: Python  my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25*
>
> Answer:

We used Hydra to configure our experiments. We created a single config file that contained all the hyperparameters for our experiments. To run an experiment, we would use the following command:



### Question 13

> **Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information**
> **is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment*
> *one would have to do ...*
>
> Answer:

We made use of hydras config files to secure that no information is lost when running experiments and that our experiments are reproducible. Whenever an experiment is run, the config file is saved in the outputs folder. To reproduce an experiment, one would have to run the same command with the same config file.

### Question 14

> **Upload 1 to 3 screenshots that show the experiments that you have done in W&B (or another experiment tracking**
> **service of your choice). This may include loss graphs, logged images, hyperparameter sweeps etc. You can take**

### Question 15

> **Docker is an important tool for creating containerized applications. Explain how you used docker in your**
> **experiments/project? Include how you would run your docker images and include a link to one of your docker files.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *For our project we developed several images: one for training, inference and deployment. For example to run the*
> *training docker image: `docker run trainer:latest lr=1e-3 batch_size=64`. Link to docker file: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

We have used docker in cloud run when runing cloud engine.

Artiffact docker image: 'docker run europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev/endless-galaxy-447815-e4/my-container/artifact-image:latest' 

### Question 16

> **When running into bugs while trying to run your experiments, how did you perform debugging? Additionally, did you**
> **try to profile your code or do you think it is already perfect?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *Debugging method was dependent on group member. Some just used ... and others used ... . We did a single profiling*
> *run of our main code at some point that showed ...*
>
> Answer:

We tried finding the bug and then used chatgpt or copilot or TA's to help debug the code. We didn't use the debugger which would have been optimal.

We did try profiling some of our code, and didn't change anything. 

## Working in the cloud

> In the following section we would like to know more about your experience when developing in the cloud.

### Question 17

> **List all the GCP services that you made use of in your project and shortly explain what each service does?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the following two services: Engine and Bucket. Engine is used for... and Bucket is used for...*
>
> Answer:

We made use of the following GCP services in our project: Engine, Bucket, Artifact Registry, and Build. Engine is used for running virtual machines in the cloud. Bucket is used for storing data in the cloud. Artifact Registry is used for storing docker images in the cloud. Build is used for building docker images in the cloud.

### Question 18

> **you used?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the compute engine to run our ... . We used instances with the following hardware: ... and we started the*
> *using a custom container: ...*
>
> Answer:

We used the compute engine to run our training jobs. We used instances with the following hardware: n1-highmem-8 and we started the instances using a custom container: europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev/endless-galaxy-447815-e4/my-container/artifact-image:latest.

### Question 19

> **Insert 1-2 images of your GCP bucket, such that we can see what data you have stored in it.**

### Question 22

> **Did you manage to train your model in the cloud using either the Engine or Vertex AI? If yes, explain how you did**
> **it. If not, describe why.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We managed to train our model in the cloud using the Engine. We did this by ... . The reason we choose the Engine*
> *was because ...*
>
> Answer:

We managed to train our model in the cloud using Vertex AI. We did this by creating a custom container with our code and pushing it to the Artifact Registry. We then created a costum job in Vertex AI that used the custom container to train the model. The reason we choose Vertex AI was because it allowed us to easily train our model in the cloud without having to worry about setting up the infrastructure ourselves.

## Deployment

### Question 23

> **Did you manage to write an API for your model? If yes, explain how you did it and if you did anything special. If**
> **not, explain how you would do it.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did manage to write an API for our model. We used FastAPI to do this. We did this by ... . We also added ...*
> *to the API to make it more ...*
>
> Answer:

We used FastAPI to write the API. We made an API that can take an image as input and then use our trained model to predict which animal is shown in the image. We also created frontend so it is possible to upload an image from the computer and then get the prediction.

### Question 24

> **Did you manage to deploy your API, either in locally or cloud? If not, describe why. If yes, describe how and**
> **preferably how you invoke your deployed service?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *For deployment we wrapped our model into application using ... . We first tried locally serving the model, which*
> *worked. Afterwards we deployed it in the cloud, using ... . To invoke the service an user would call*
> *`curl -X POST -F "file=@file.json"<weburl>`*
>
> Answer:

We deployed our API locally first. To run the API locally the user would call: uvicorn src.image_classifier.api:app --reload

Then the user can access the API on http://127.0.0.1:8000 and upload an image.

### Question 25

> **Did you perform any unit testing and load testing of your API? If yes, explain how you did it and what results for**
> **the load testing did you get. If not, explain how you would do it.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *For unit testing we used ... and for load testing we used ... . The results of the load testing showed that ...*
> *before the service crashed.*
>
> Answer:

Yes we did both unittesting and load testing of the API. To do the unittesting we used pytest, testing for: . And to do the load test we used Locust to test the predict endpoint of the API by simulating users uploading images for prediction. The results of the load test is that the API is performing well with no failures and reasonable response times.

### Question 26

> **Did you manage to implement monitoring of your deployed model? If yes, explain how it works. If not, explain how**
> **monitoring would help the longevity of your application.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.

## Overall discussion of project

> In the following section we would like you to think about the general structure of your project.

### Question 27

> **How many credits did you end up using during the project and what service was most expensive? In general what do**
> **you think about working in the cloud?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *Group member 1 used ..., Group member 2 used ..., in total ... credits was spend during development. The service*
> *costing the most was ... due to ... . Working in the cloud was ...*
>
> Answer:

We have used around 25 dollars and the training was the thing that was most expensive seeing as we did it wrong the first time and didn't save it correctly. This meant that we had to do it five times using a lot of credits.

### Question 28

> **Did you implement anything extra in your project that is not covered by other questions? Maybe you implemented**
> **a frontend for your API, use extra version control features, a drift detection service, a kubernetes cluster etc.**
> **If yes, explain what you did and why.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 0-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We implemented a frontend for our API. We did this because we wanted to show the user ... . The frontend was*
> *implemented using ...*
>
> Answer:

As previously mentioned in question 23 we also made a frontend for the API, to make it easier to use. The frontend makes it possible to upload an image and get a prediction by implementing an HTML file.

### Question 29

> **Include a figure that describes the overall architecture of your system and what services that you make use of.**
> **You can take inspiration from [this figure](figures/overview.png). Additionally, in your own words, explain the**
> **overall steps in figure.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 200-400 words
>
> Example:
>
> *The starting point of the diagram is our local setup, where we integrated ... and ... and ... into our code.*
> *Whenever we commit code and push to GitHub, it auto triggers ... and ... . From there the diagram shows ...*
>
> Answer:

![Pipeline](figures/image-3.png)

The starting point here in our pipeline is the local device of the devs which is where the code is created and training data is kept originaly. From this point we have pre-commit check on new code followed by commit and push before anything is uploaded to Github. From GitHub pytest test if the scripts are able to be run on more systems and version. The training data is uploaded to Google Cloud Storage in a bucket where it is easily accessed. The github repository is then sent to Google Cloud where a container is created from which a docker image is made and able to be pulled by the user. In the Google Cloud we then are able to use the image and the training data to train models in Ai Vertex from which the model is saved in the same bucket. This can then be run by a Google Cloud run as a api which creates a frontend able to be used by users. This api then saves the tested images in the bucket with it's prediction.
